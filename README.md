Meta information for RNA-seq samples used in the paper can be found in SupplementaryTable1.csv
DNA methylation samples can be found under the GEO IDs:
GSE41037, GSE54848, GSE40279, GSE42861, GSE50660, GSE106648, GSE179325, and GSE223748

Note that due to the nature of the stochastic variation accumulation simulations the coefficients and results might change slightly with every run.
